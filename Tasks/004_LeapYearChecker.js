// ✅ Leap Year Checker:

// Create a program that determines whether a given year is a leap year. 
// A leap year is divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless 
// it is also divisible by 400. Use an if-else statement to make this determination.
// year = 2026 , no

let year=2100;
 if(year%4==0&&year%100!=0 || year%400==0){
    console.log(`${year} is a leap year.`);
}
else{
    console.log(`${year} is not a leap year.`);
}
